# Demo Application - REST Web Service with CQRS Architecture

This is a demo application that simulates a REST web service built with the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) architecture.

## Getting Started

To start up the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the Axon Server using Docker Compose:
   ```
   docker-compose up

   This command will launch the Axon Server, which is used for managing events and commands in the CQRS architecture.

2. Run the application using Maven (Make sure you have Maven installed):
   ```
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

   This command will start the demo application.

   

4. To view the axon server and monitor the events data store
